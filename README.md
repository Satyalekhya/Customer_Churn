# Customer_Churn
This project analyzes bank customer churn using the Churn_Modelling.csv dataset. Data was cleaned, transformed, and feature-engineered in MySQL (one-hot encoding, age bucketing, train/test split) and explored through SQL queries and visualizations (churn by age, geography, gender). This project demonstrates the full ML pipeline .
